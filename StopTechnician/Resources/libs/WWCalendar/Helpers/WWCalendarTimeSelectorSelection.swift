/// Set `optionSelectionType` with one of the following:
///
/// `Single`: This will only allow the selection of a single date. If applicable, this also allows selection of year and time.
///
/// `Multiple`: This will allow the selection of multiple dates. This automatically ignores the attribute of `optionPickerStyle`, hence selection of multiple year and time is currently not available.
///
/// `Range`: This will allow the selection of a range of dates. This automatically ignores the attribute of `optionPickerStyle`, hence selection of multiple year and time is currently not available.

/// - Note:
/// Selection styles will only affect date selection. It is currently not possible to select multiple/range
